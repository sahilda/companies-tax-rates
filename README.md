## Company tax rates

This project is based on the increasing practice that many American companies are participants in - making use of tax loopholes to pay minimal taxes, and **well** below the corporate tax-rate of 35%. This project will house the files, with the goal of having a web-interface with various statistics on different companies.

Finance data is being scraped from: https://www.google.com/finance.

Company information is pulled from: http://www.nasdaq.com/screening/company-list.aspx.

I would appreciate all and any help. This project is purely for educational purposes to learn, and expose more about those around us.
